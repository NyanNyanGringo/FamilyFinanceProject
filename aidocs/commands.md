- Displays total monthly expenses
- Updates automatically as new expenses are added

**Response Format**:
```

–ü—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç—ã - 15,000 –∏–∑ 20,000 RUB
–¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç - 3,500 –∏–∑ 5,000 RUB
–†–∞–∑–≤–ª–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è - 8,000 –∏–∑ 10,000 RUB

–í—Å–µ–≥–æ: 26,500 RUB
```

[‚úÖ –ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ]
```

**Data Source**:
- Sheet: `#memory`
- Cell A1: All memories stored as text, separated by newlines
- Integration: Memories are automatically included in all OpenAI API calls

## Command Features

### Auto-completion
All commands support Telegram's built-in auto-completion:
- Type `/` to see available commands
- Commands show descriptions in the suggestion list
- Implemented via `BotCommand` registration on startup

### Error Handling
Commands include proper error handling:
- Connection errors show user-friendly messages
- Missing data handled gracefully
- Loading indicators while fetching data

## Implementation Details

### Command Registration
Commands are registered in `set_bot_commands()` function:
```python
commands = [
    BotCommand("expenses_status", "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞—Å—Ö–æ–¥—ã –∑–∞ —Ç–µ–∫—É—â–∏–π –º–µ—Å—è—Ü"),
    BotCommand("memory", "–£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏"),
]
```

### Handler Structure
Each command has a dedicated handler function:
- Receives `Update` and `Context` objects
- Sends initial "Loading..." message
- Fetches data from Google Sheets
- Formats and sends response
- Handles errors gracefully

## Future Commands (Planned)

### /income_status
- Show monthly income by source
- Compare to expected income

### /balance
- Show current account balances
- Display by currency

### /transfer_history
- Recent transfers between accounts
- Filter by date range

### /help
- List all available commands
- Show usage examples

## Adding New Commands

To add a new command:
1. Create handler function in `server.py`
2. Register with `CommandHandler` in main
3. Add to `set_bot_commands()` for auto-completion
4. Document in this file

## Best Practices

### Command Design

- Provide loading feedback
- Handle errors gracefully

### Data Access
- Use dedicated Google Sheets tabs
- Cache data when appropriate
- Minimize API calls

### User Experience
- Respond quickly with initial message
- Edit message with results (avoid spam)
- Use clear, formatted text
- Support multiple languages
