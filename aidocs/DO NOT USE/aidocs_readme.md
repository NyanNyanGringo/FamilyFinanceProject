Folder `aidocs` is memory bridge between LLM sessions that contains relevant, up to date information about project:

* `architecture` - technical skeleton of a system, defining how its parts are arranged, connected, and interact with each other. It covers the structure of components, communication methods, technology choices, and principles of scalability, security, and sustainability.

* `infrastructure` - the entire technical environment of the project - from servers and cloud platforms to CI/CD tools, monitoring tools, data storage and version control systems.

* `sessions` - stores all the LLM session files in folders like **session_0000.md** one by one.

* `safete.md` - data protection mechanisms, encryption, access control, auditing of activities and compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g. GDPR, ISO, SOC 2).

* `tests.md` - approaches to ensuring product stability and reliability: unit tests, integration tests, manual testing, acceptance testing, and the use of LLM tools for automation.
