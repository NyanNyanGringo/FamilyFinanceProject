## Detailed Product Description

**What is this project about?**
It all started when I created a Google Sheet to track our family expenses. The idea turned out to be so convenient that my whole family appreciated it. Over time, the spreadsheet evolved — it began to include income, expenses, transfers, account adjustments, balances, account management, and other powerful features enabled by Google Sheets.

Then came the challenge of entering data. We decided to use Telegram: we would simply send voice messages with the relevant details. About once every week or two, I would manually listen to each message, transcribe the data into the spreadsheet, and mark each processed message with a like.

This project was created to eliminate that manual step.


## Users

**Who will use this product?**
This product is strictly for personal use. It is not — and will not in the foreseeable future be — aimed at a broader audience.


## User Stories

**How will users interact with this product?**
A user simply sends a voice message to a Telegram chat. The bot interprets the context, pulls necessary metadata from Google Sheets, determines the type of operation — income, expense, transfer, or adjustment — and then automatically adds a corresponding row to the sheet.

This saves me (and potentially others) a significant amount of time.


## Problems Product Solve

**Which problems does this product solve?**
The project is designed to save time on recording expenses, income, and transfers — making the process fast and user-friendly. The idea is that the user only needs to sit down once a month to review and adjust account balances.

As a result, they always have up-to-date, real-time information about the state of all their accounts.


## Non-Goals

**What should the product not solve?**
At this stage, the product is not intended for mass adoption. It is not a global solution — it is a tailored tool for a single family. Of course, we aim for clean and reliable code, but universality is not a priority. This is, first and foremost, a personal solution for the Parfentiev family.
