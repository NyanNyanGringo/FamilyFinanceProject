# 1. Session Goals:
Prepare the code for a more complex feature - change the user story so that when a user sends a message in Telegram and the bot replies successfully, it should automatically be added to Google Sheets without needing to click the Accept button. The user should still be able to delete the message via a delete button with a two-step confirmation flow.

# 2. TODOs:
- [ ] Create session file to track progress
- [ ] Update RequestData to include telegram_message_id field
- [ ] Update get_values_to_update_for_request to include Telegram message ID in correct columns (L for expenses, M for transfers, K for incomes)
- [ ] Add Google Sheets deletion functionality
- [ ] Modify voice_message_handler to auto-save valid data
- [ ] Create new keyboard functions for Delete button and confirmation
- [ ] Update button_click_handler for delete flow
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Test the complete flow

# 3. Progress:
[2025-07-31 00:00]  
Session started. Goal is to implement auto-save to Google Sheets with two-step delete functionality. Created session file and planned implementation steps.

[2025-07-31 00:30]  
Implemented all required changes:
1. Added telegram_message_id field to RequestData class
2. Updated get_values_to_update_for_request to save message ID in correct columns (L for expenses, M for transfers, K for incomes)
3. Created delete_row_by_telegram_id function to find and delete rows by Telegram ID
4. Added new keyboard functions: get_delete_button_keyboard and get_delete_confirmation_keyboard
5. Modified voice_message_handler to auto-save valid data and show Delete button
6. Updated button_click_handler to handle delete, delete_confirm, and delete_cancel actions
7. Added proper error handling and status messages

The implementation is complete. When a user sends a valid voice message, it will automatically be saved to Google Sheets and show a Delete button. The delete flow requires confirmation before removing the data.

Fixed auto-save error: "Расходы is not a valid value for ListName". The issue was in create_request_data_from_message where we incorrectly mapped OperationTypes to ListName. Fixed by using direct enum mapping instead of get_item() with value strings.

[2025-07-31 01:05]  
Fixed missing date field error. The request_message from ChatGPT doesn't include a date field, but RequestData expects it. Fixed by only adding date to the data dict if it exists in request_message, allowing the default_factory to generate the current date.

[2025-07-31 01:10]  
Fixed transfer auto-save error. ChatGPT returns different field names for transfers (write_off_account/write_off_amount instead of account/amount) and doesn't provide transfer_type. Fixed by mapping field names correctly and defaulting transfer_type to "Transfer".
