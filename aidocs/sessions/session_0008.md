# 1. Session Goals:
Plan and implement a memory functional that allows users to store priority instructions in Google Sheets by sending messages starting with "#" and manage them via /memory command.

# 2. TODOs:
- [x] Read project documentation to understand current structure
- [x] Analyze current Google Sheets integration architecture  
- [x] Design memory functional with #memory prefix detection
- [x] Plan /memory command for deletion functionality
- [x] Create session file to track progress
- [x] Add memory sheet to ListName enum in google_utilities.py
- [x] Create memory helper functions in google_utilities.py
- [x] Implement memory_text_handler in server.py
- [x] Implement memory_command_handler in server.py
- [x] Register handlers and command in main()
- [x] Integrate memories into OpenAI API calls
- [x] Test the implementation
- [x] Refactor button_click_handler for better separation of concerns
- [x] Move "/expenses_status" sheet name to ListName enum

# 3. Progress:
[2025-08-04 10:45]
Started session to plan memory functional. Read project documentation including architecture.md, about_google_sheet.md, and commands.md. Analyzed current implementation - found no text message handler exists, only voice and command handlers.

[2025-08-04 10:50]
Designed memory functional architecture: Store memories in "#memory" sheet cell A1 separated by newlines. Text messages starting with "#" trigger storage. /memory command shows list with deletion options. Memories will be passed as priority context to all OpenAI API calls.

[2025-08-04 10:55]
Created comprehensive implementation plan with 6 main components: Google Sheets integration, text message handler, command handler, LLM integration, handler registration, and error handling. Plan approved by user, ready to start implementation.

[2025-08-04 11:10]
Implementation completed:
1. Added "#memory" to ListName enum in google_utilities.py
2. Created memory helper functions: get_memories(), add_memory(), delete_memory()
3. Implemented memory_text_handler to detect and save messages starting with "#"
4. Implemented memory_command_handler with inline keyboard for deletion
5. Updated button_click_handler to handle memory deletion callbacks
6. Registered handlers and added /memory command to bot commands
7. Integrated memories into all OpenAI API calls via _get_memory_context()

The memory functional is now fully implemented and ready for testing.

[2025-08-04 11:30]
Performed refactoring to improve code maintainability:
1. Added expenses_status = "/expenses_status" to ListName enum
2. Refactored button_click_handler following Single Responsibility Principle:
   - Created memory_button_handler for memory-related operations
   - Created operation_button_handler for financial operations
   - Updated button_click_handler to act as a router
3. Fixed function naming inconsistency (get_delete_keyboard vs get_delete_button_keyboard)

The code is now cleaner and more maintainable with better separation of concerns.
