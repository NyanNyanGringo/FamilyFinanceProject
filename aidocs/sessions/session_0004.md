# 1. Session Goals:
Change the logic of user experience for the Telegram bot:
1. When user sends a voice message and bot replies successfully, immediately send data to Google Sheets (no confirmation required)
2. Replace accept/decline buttons with a single "Delete" button that requires two-step confirmation
3. Fix the issue where multiple concurrent messages cause button conflicts (only last message buttons work)

# 2. TODOs:
- [x] Analyze current message handling and button implementation
- [x] Understand Google Sheets integration flow
- [x] Identify the concurrent message button conflict issue
- [x] Fix concurrent message handling to properly track button states per message

# 3. Progress:
[2025-07-30 12:00]
Session started. Goals defined: implement immediate Google Sheets saving, add two-step delete button, fix concurrent message handling issues.

[2025-07-30 12:15]
Implemented unique message ID tracking system to fix concurrent message handling. Modified button creation to include message_id in callback_data, updated button_click_handler to extract message_id and retrieve correct data, added cleanup mechanism to prevent memory growth. The fix stores message-specific data with unique keys like "msg_{message_id}" instead of overwriting shared context.user_data.
