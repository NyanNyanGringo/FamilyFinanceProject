[2025-07-29 14:03]  
Session started. Read aidocs folder contents and planned architecture document. Found that planned_database_architecture.md already exists but appears to be empty (1 line only). The planned architecture shows a hybrid AI Agents + Managers system with ConversationManager handling all database operations and conversation persistence.

[2025-07-29 14:05]  
Completed comprehensive database architecture documentation. Created detailed schema with 6 tables: conversations (core state), conversation_data (JSON operation data), message_history (complete message threading), agent_questions (AI agent interactions), user_sessions (user context), and operation_templates (AI training data). Documented complete data flow, ConversationManager methods, and migration strategy. All TODOs completed successfully.
