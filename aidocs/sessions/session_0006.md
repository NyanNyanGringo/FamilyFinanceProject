Session started. Goal is to implement /expenses_status command that reads from Google Sheets and formats expense data. Created session file and analyzed existing codebase structure.

[2025-08-03 14:15]  
Implemented /expenses_status command handler:
1. Added CommandHandler import to server.py
2. Created expenses_status_handler function that:
   - Reads currency code from /expenses_status!A2
   - Reads expense categories from /expenses_status!B2:B
   - Reads amounts from /expenses_status!C2:C
   - Reads total amount from /expenses_status!D2
   - Formats the message according to user requirements
3. Registered the command handler in the run() function
4. Added error handling for Google Sheets API errors

The implementation is complete. Users can now use /expenses_status command to get formatted expense data from the Google Sheets.

Added bot command registration for autocompletion:
1. Imported BotCommand from telegram
2. Created set_bot_commands async function that:
   - Creates a list of BotCommand objects with command names and descriptions
   - Calls set_my_commands to register them with Telegram
3. Set application.post_init = set_bot_commands to register commands on bot startup
4. This enables command autocompletion when users type "/" in Telegram

Now when users type "/" in Telegram, they will see the /expenses_status command with its description.

Fixed message editing issue:
1. Changed expenses_status_handler to save the initial message object
2. Used edit_text() instead of reply_text() for the final result
3. Now only one message appears and gets updated from "Загружаю данные о расходах..." to the final expense report
4. This provides a cleaner user experience with no duplicate messages

[2025-08-03 15:00]  
Updated expense format to show actual vs expected amounts:
1. Added reading from D2:D column for expected amounts per category
2. Changed total amount to read from E2 (instead of D2)
3. Updated message format to show "Продукты - 14,851 из 45,000 RSD"
4. This helps users track their spending against budget
