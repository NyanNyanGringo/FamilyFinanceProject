# 1. Session Goals:
Modify the FamilyFinanceProject code to use the new Service Account JSON key (familyfinanceproject-106ffdcf9150.json) instead of the current OAuth flow authentication for Google Sheets integration.

# 2. TODOs:
- [x] Create session file for Service Account setup
- [x] Read aidocs folder to understand project structure  
- [x] Examine current Google authentication code
- [x] Modify code to use Service Account credentials

# 3. Progress:
[2025-07-29 16:03]  
Started session. User provided Service Account JSON key file. Need to modify the authentication flow from OAuth to Service Account authentication for Google Sheets API integration.

[2025-07-29 16:08]  
Successfully modified google_utilities.py to use Service Account authentication:
- Replaced OAuth flow imports with service account imports
- Updated _authenticate_with_google() function to use Service Account key file
- Removed unused imports (shutil, Request, exceptions, InstalledAppFlow)
- Added _get_root_path() helper function
- Changed authentication to use familyfinanceproject-106ffdcf9150.json directly
