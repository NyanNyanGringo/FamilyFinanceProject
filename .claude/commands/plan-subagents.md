# plan-subagents

Read the CLAUDE subagent documentation:
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents

Firstly, **analyze current project**: read all the documentation, search files structure, read code in certain files when it needs and analyze `.claude` folder to study agents that already in production.

Secondly, **give a decision about CLAUDE subagents**, which of them do you and user have to add/edit/delete (update) to fully close all the project needs.

Finally, **make a TODO list plan and ask** user to add/edit/delete (update) CLAUDE subagents.

Warning: to create CLAUDE subagents call meta agent! All the agents should be strictly created by meta-agent.
