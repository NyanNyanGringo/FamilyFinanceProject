# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# FamilyFinanceProject

## Overview

FamilyFinanceProject is a Telegram bot that manages personal finances through natural language processing. Users interact via voice or text messages to track expenses, incomes, and transfers in a Google Sheets backend.

## Core Functionality

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The system uses an orchestrator agent that routes requests to specialized agents:
- **Main Orchestrator**: Analyzes user intent and delegates to appropriate agents
- **Expense Agent**: Processes expense transactions
- **Income Agent**: Processes income transactions
- **Transfer Agent**: Handles transfers and account adjustments
- **Query Agent**: Responds to balance inquiries and generates reports
- **Utility Agent**: Manages backups and system settings

### Transaction Management

#### Supported Operations
1. **Expenses**: Track spending with category, account, amount, and optional comments
2. **Incomes**: Record earnings with source category and destination account
3. **Transfers**: Move money between accounts with currency conversion
4. **Adjustments**: Correct account balances

#### Transaction Features
- Automatic processing without confirmation buttons
- Natural language understanding for all operations
- Multi-transaction support in single message (using "firstly", "secondly")

### Reply-Based Editing
